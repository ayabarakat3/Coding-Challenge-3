# Coding-Challenge-3
In this coding challenge, monthly sales figures will be used to determine a company's sales teams' performance.  The average sales, performance ratings and more information will be calculated by creating functions. 
This will help simplify and clarify information needed to contribute to the decisions made by the company.
